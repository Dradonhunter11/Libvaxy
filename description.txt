A library mod providing functionality for the rest of my mods.

You can use it for yourself, the documentation and source code are public.

Here's an overview of what Libvaxy provides:
- Easy runtime reflection with automatic caching, so you don't have to do it yourself
- A ModAnalyzer class to retrieve a mod's resources without hassle, along with stuff such as item count, mod size, etc.
- Manipulating and creating textures at runtime, with automatic cleaning up
- The ability to turn tiles into falling tiles, without any extra work done on your part
