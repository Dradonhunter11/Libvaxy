A library mod providing functionality for the rest of my mods.

You can use it for yourself, the documentation and source code are public.

Libvaxy is a utility mod that aims at speeding up development, and eliminating repetitive boilerplate code, so you can get things done faster.

Here's an overview of what Libvaxy provides:
- Easy runtime reflection with automatic caching, so you don't have to do it yourself
- A ModAnalyzer class to retrieve a mod's resources without hassle (items, projectiles, globalnpcs, backgrounds, etc)
- Manipulating and creating textures at runtime, with automatic cleaning up
- The ability to turn tiles into falling tiles, without any extra work done on your part
- Various attributes that ease hooking and detouring methods
- A handful of WorldGen utilities, along with the popular FastNoise library
- Classes that allow you to add content quicker (SimpleItem, SimpleTileItem, etc)
